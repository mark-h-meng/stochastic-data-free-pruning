Our python code can run pruning progressively and evaluate robustness automatically.
You may execute one of the following source code to run the project, depending on which dataset & model you would like to try:

* batch_pruning_evaluation.py (MNIST, MLP)
* batch_pruning_evaluation_chest.py (Chest X-ray, CNN)
* batch_pruning_evaluation_kaggle.py (Credit Card Fraud, MLP)
* batch_pruning_evaluation_cifar.py (CIFAR-10, CNN)
